            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tony Devarco, Artist</h1><p>In 1986, as a young artist living in NYC, Tony was introduced to the sculptor Mark di Suvero. He spent a year and a half as di Suvero's assistant while living and working on his art across from the recently opened Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City. Tony had the enjoyment of exhibiting his work in museums and galleries in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania through 1994 and after leaving NYC in 1988 he taught Art Administration at the College Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati. 

He was appointed Executive Director of the Buckminster Fuller Institute in 1991 and led the organization until May of 1995 after moving its headquarters and Fuller Archives from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e301bced8d51e5f66e66e64ca632255fc25036e3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mayako Nakamura, Artist</h1><p>Mayako Nakamura is a painter, living and working in Tokyo. She has been exhibiting her work in both domestic and foreign venues since 2009. She explains her working method: "I trace the shapes of space and boundaries in everyday, as my body feels. When numerous senses woven together with the impressions of the reality that my mind has already known, and with the universal shapes that my kokoro longs for, another day appears on my canvas. I'm attempting to create another everyday, which seems more essential than the actual living, by painting atmospheres; emotions and actions that can't be expressed by words; nothing special, but surely existing." Mayako's works have been used as book covers and on CD jacket illustrations, she collaborates with clothing brands, creates clocks and ceramic paintings as well as paintings on canvas.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/da0b0859de97f9400191fae8c2a816c33ab272e6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
