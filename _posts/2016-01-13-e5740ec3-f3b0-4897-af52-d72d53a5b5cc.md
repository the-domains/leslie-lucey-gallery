# Mayako Nakamura, Artist

Mayako Nakamura is a painter, living and working in Tokyo. She has been exhibiting her work in both domestic and foreign venues since 2009\. She explains her working method: "I trace the shapes of space and boundaries in everyday, as my body feels. When numerous senses woven together with the impressions of the reality that my mind has already known, and with the universal shapes that my kokoro longs for, another day appears on my canvas. I'm attempting to create another everyday, which seems more essential than the actual living, by painting atmospheres; emotions and actions that can't be expressed by words; nothing special, but surely existing." Mayako's works have been used as book covers and on CD jacket illustrations, she collaborates with clothing brands, creates clocks and ceramic paintings as well as paintings on canvas.
