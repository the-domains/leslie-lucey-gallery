# Leslie Lucey, Art Collector

Leslie began dreaming of building an art collection when attending the prestigious Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA in the summer of 2007\. Her passion and love for art developed while walking the stark-white halls colored with student paintings, sculpture and the like during finals week every term. Leslie graduated with honors and a BFA in the winter of 2009, having focused on filmmaking, writing and producing. In the years following she produced commercials, original scripted and non-scripted branded content for clients such as AT&T, IMAX, Cosmopolitan Hotel, and others. 

In 2012 Leslie embarked on her first independent feature film production in Malta. She produced the first feature film ever to be submitted to the Academy Awards in the foreign language category for the Country in 2014\. Whilst, producing films, and other projects Leslie became more and more convinced that her experiences and expertise in producing film could translate into creating a new kind of Gallery that would bring together her love of art and her passion for filmmaking.  She started partnering with new and emerging artists in early 2016, and thus Leslie Lucey Gallery was born.
