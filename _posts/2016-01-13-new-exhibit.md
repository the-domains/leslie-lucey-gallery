_A work of art is an eternity of emotion. - Leslie Lucey_

Our premiere exhibition will merge storytelling, technology, and fine art. Not only will you see the evolution of a piece, you will experience the viewing of it in a new way. We are utilizing 3D and Virtual Reality to weave together the story of each piece. "Spirited Nature, Traces of Light" is a collaboration between two incredible artists. Tony Devarco (Santa Cruz, CA) and Mayako Nakamura (Tokyo, Japan) met in early 2013 and began collaborating shortly thereafter. Together they have created an exhibition that exquisitely merges their very different techniques.

"I wanted to create an expierence around the process of collecting art. Why should it just be looking and buying? When you see a work of art it should inspire you. It was important to me, that we convey the story behind the art. What is the artist passionate about? What brought them to this convergence of feeling and expression? For me, when I know the story behind something, I get more from it. The Leslie Lucey Gallery was created to bring art to the world in a new and interactive way, where the art becomes only a part of the story." - Leslie Lucey
