ARTIST PROFILE

Tony Devarco

In 1986, as a young artist living in NYC, Tony was introduced to the sculptor Mark di Suvero. He spent a year and a half as di Suvero's assistant while living and working on his art across from the recently opened Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City. Tony had the enjoyment of exhibiting his work in museums and galleries in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania through 1994 and after leaving NYC in 1988 he taught Art Administration at the College Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati. 
He was appointed Executive Director of the Buckminster Fuller Institute in 1991 and led the organization until May of 1995 after moving its headquarters and Fuller Archives from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara.

Following a brief stint working as the Associate Executive Director for the World Game Institute in Philadelphia, Tony moved with his family to Santa Cruz, California in 1997 to take a position as Vice President of US Operations for WorldSat International. In 1999 he joined Silicon Graphics (SGI) where he held various senior marketing positions until the fall of 2006\. Tony then worked with Symantec and became Vice President of Owen Media, a marketing and communications company in the spring of 2007\. He rejoined SGI in 2009 and is currently Director of Manufacturing Solutions. 
Since 2005, Tony has begun to return to his art with a fresh vision, vigor and new tools. 

Through his years in the digital environments of Silicon Valley while traveling regularly to Japan, Europe and other locations around the globe, his artist's tools became more technological and ephemeral - a laptop and a digital camera. With these tools he has explored a completely unique approach to digital mixed media. After a 15-year hiatus from creating art for public display he presented his new work, "Stone Water Spirit" at Land of Medicine Buddha, Santa Cruz County in 2006 and 2007\. This led to the development of a broad portfolio of new digital works ready for large scale display and exhibition. 

In 2012, Tony had a one person show called "Way of Time" at the Marta Hewett Gallery. It was reviewed in the art journal "AEQAI" aeqai.com/main/2012/10/all-kinds-of-time/ The book "Way of Time- Spinning the Threads of Kairos & Chronos" by Bonnie and Tony DeVarco is available as an e-book store.blurb.com/ebooks/304970-way-of-time or a hardback www.blurb.com/b/3463580-way-of-time.
